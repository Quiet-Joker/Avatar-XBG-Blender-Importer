# Avatar-XBG-Blender-Importer
An XBG model importer for James Cameron's Avatar: The Game. Updated with AI from it's original Blender 2.49b source.

Origianlly you would need an old blender version like Blender 2.49b and a special library to be able to load the 3D models into blender but since it's a super old version of blender and no one knows how the script worked/barely. I decided to update the script to make it work with modern Blender 5.0
It took a couple months, up to a year or two but... it's 80% finished. The model importing works fine, im still trying to fix the material/texture importing as well to make it as one click as possible.

To do:
1. Fix models that won't import no matter what like "Samson_pilotable" some models that give an "Expected 4 byte error" WILL NOT import no matter what, we ares still working on it.
2. Fix texture placement/reverse engineering. (more on that on the xbm viewer)
3. Fix bug of multiple duplicate textures.

Note: Still work in progress, as always an initial version is on the public branch but the more up to date version with bugs is in the Dev branch.
